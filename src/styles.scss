// About this file
// 'sui-integration.scss.tmp' is a template file that is used by the config manager
// build to replace the '@@CUSTOMER@@' flag with the correct customer implementation
// so styles will be built based on that customer. At the end of the build process, a
// 'sui-integration.scss' file is generated with the correct customer to be built.
//
// Note: This is a deliberate file that should be committed and any intended changes for
// 'sui-integration.scss' should be made here. DO NOT DELETE
